            1 in every 3 people around the world do not have clean water to drink. Millions are forced
            to drink dirty, unsafe water that could kill them, and is spreading deadly diseases among
            vulnerable communities. Women and children are forced to walk miles each day on dangerous
            terrain to fetch clean water, when they should be at home, at school, thriving and content.

            the world just collecting water.
